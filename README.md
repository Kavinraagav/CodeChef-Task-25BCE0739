#AlgoLabs — Algorithm Visualizer
AlgoLabs is a simple and interactive algorithm visualizer built to help understand algorithms through clear and intuitive animations.
The project focuses on conceptual clarity, especially for Binary Search, by visualizing search space elimination instead of confusing comparisons.

#Features
*Sorting Algorithms
*Bubble Sort
*Selection Sort
*Searching Algorithm
*Binary Search with elimination-based visualization
*Play / Pause / Reset controls
*Adjustable array size and animation speed
*Clean, button-based algorithm selection

#Design Approach
*Sorting algorithms highlight comparisons and swaps
*Binary Search highlights range elimination
  - Eliminated elements fade out
  - Mid element is highlighted
  - Found element is clearly marked
